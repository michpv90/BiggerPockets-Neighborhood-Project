# BiggerPockets-Neighborhood-Project

## Background
As an avid listener of the BiggerPockets podcast, I wanted to utilize my new data analytical skills to create a project that would help me analyze areas to consider buying a home as a rookie investor. In the BiggerPockets podcast 484, Bradon Turner explained some qualities to rank neighborhoods as A, B, and C, with A being the best and C being the least desirable. I will be analyzing data from Montgomery County, Maryland, to rank neighborhoods to determine which community would be an excellent place to invest.

## Neighborhood Rank Factors
- New Building Construction
- Stores in Area
- Great Schools
- Real Estate Prices
- Income
- Vacancy
- Crime Rates
